Hello!

Since TONICS website was hacked, I thought I make a updated list of files needed to run a server for Arma3 Altis Life RPG. Files are from a fresh install of 4.4r3 on a windows server 2012 dedicated machine. Visit my website for the tutorial! http://altisliferpg.freeforums.net/thread/4/arma-altis-life-server-4r3
